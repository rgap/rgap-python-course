# PEP 8: Style Guide for Python Code

## Introduction

PEP 8 is the style guide for writing clean and readable Python code. It was authored by Guido van Rossum, Barry Warsaw, and Nick Coghlan, and it lays out conventions for writing Python code that is consistent and easy to understand.

It was created to ensure that Python code is not only functional but also readable and maintainable. By following PEP 8, developers can write code that is easier for others to read and contribute to.
