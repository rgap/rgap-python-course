# Comparison/Conditional Operators in Python
# Python Version: Comparison operators have been part of Python since version 1.0 (January 1994).

# Comparison operators allow you to compare two values, returning a boolean result (True or False).

# Equal to (==)
print(f"5 == 5: {5 == 5}")  # Outputs: True

# Not equal to (!=)
print(f"5 != 3: {5 != 3}")  # Outputs: True

# Greater than (>)
print(f"5 > 3: {5 > 3}")  # Outputs: True

# Less than (<)
print(f"5 < 3: {5 < 3}")  # Outputs: False

# Greater than or equal to (>=)
print(f"5 >= 5: {5 >= 5}")  # Outputs: True

# Less than or equal to (<=)
print(f"3 <= 5: {3 <= 5}")  # Outputs: True

# Note: Comparison operators are commonly used in conditional statements like if-else and loops.
