# Introduction to PEP

## What is PEP?

PEP stands for PYTHON ENHANCEMENT PROPOSAL. It is a design document that provides information to the Python community, or describes a new feature or process for Python.

PEPs are intended to propose major new features, document design decisions, or provide information to the community.

## Historical Context

The PEP system was introduced by Barry Warsaw in 2000. The first PEP, known as PEP 1, outlines the purpose and guidelines for PEPs. The most well-known PEP is PEP 8, which provides coding conventions for writing Python code.

PEPs are a crucial part of Python's development process. They allow the community to suggest, discuss, and implement changes to the language. PEPs are not limited to code changes; they also include process improvements and policy decisions that impact Python development and use.

## Types of PEPs

1. **Standards Track PEPs**: These are proposals that change the language, library, or implementation of Python. They require broad consensus and must go through a rigorous review process.

2. **Informational PEPs**: These provide general guidelines or information to the Python community. They don't necessarily propose changes to Python itself but may explain a concept or process.

3. **Process PEPs**: These describe a process surrounding Python's development. Examples include release schedules, governance models, or community guidelines.

## Why PEPs Matter

PEPs are the primary mechanism for proposing significant changes to Python. They ensure that any changes are well-documented, carefully considered, and reviewed by the Python community and its leadership.

Understanding the PEP process is essential for anyone looking to contribute to Python or even for those who want to write Pythonic code by following community-approved standards like PEP 8.

## Example PEPs to Explore

- **PEP 8**: Style Guide for Python Code
- **PEP 20**: The Zen of Python
- **PEP 257**: Docstring Conventions
- **PEP 484**: Type Hints

In the following folders, we will explore specific PEPs, starting with PEP 8, and how they influence Python code today.
