# The built-in namespace is always available in Python, containing functions and exceptions.
# It's defined when Python starts and includes functions like 'print()' and constants like 'True', 'False'.

# Using `dir(__builtins__)`, we can see all the names available in the built-in namespace.
print(dir(__builtins__))  # Lists all built-in functions and constants.
