# The History of YAML

## Origins of YAML

YAML was created in 1999 by Clark Evans, with the help of Ingy d√∂t Net and Oren Ben-Kiki. The primary motivation was to create a human-readable data serialization format that was easy to use and understand. At the time, existing markup languages like XML were considered overly complex and difficult to work with, especially for configuration files and data exchange.

## Development Timeline

- **1999**: Initial concept and development of YAML.
- **2001**: The first official release of YAML (YAML 1.0).
- **2004**: YAML 1.1 introduced, with better support for various data types and improved parsing rules.
- **2009**: YAML 1.2 released, fully aligning with JSON, making it easier to interchange data between systems using these formats.

## YAML 1.0

YAML 1.0, released in 2001, was the first official specification of the language. It introduced the basic syntax and structure that defined YAML, emphasizing human readability and ease of use.

### Key Features:

- Simple and readable syntax.
- Support for lists and dictionaries (mappings).
- Anchors and aliases for reusing content.

## YAML 1.1

Released in 2004, YAML 1.1 introduced several improvements over the 1.0 version. It enhanced the parsing rules and expanded support for more complex data types.

### Key Features:

- Improved support for binary data.
- Introduction of new data types, such as sets and ordered mappings.
- Enhanced parsing of booleans and nulls.

## YAML 1.2

YAML 1.2, released in 2009, is the latest version of the specification. It was designed to be fully compatible with JSON, making it easier to use YAML in environments where JSON was already prevalent.

### Key Features:

- Full JSON compatibility.
- Streamlined syntax for complex structures.
- Improved cross-platform support and interoperability.
