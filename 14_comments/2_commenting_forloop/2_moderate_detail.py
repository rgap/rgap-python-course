# Example 2: Moderate Detail (Focusing on Intent)

# Initialize an empty list to store squares of numbers
squares = []
# Loop through the first 10 numbers to calculate their squares
for x in range(10):
    square = x**2
    squares.append(square)

# Output the squares to verify correctness
print(squares)
