# __init__.py
# Python Version: The `__init__.py` file has been used to indicate that a
# directory is a package since Python 1.5.2.

# __init__.py tells the the python interpreter that the folder is package
# Without __init__.py, my_package is just a folder
#
# Feature introduced in Python 3.3: "Implicit Namespace Packages"
# it allows the creation of packages without an __init__.py file


print("Package `my_package` is initialized")
